# Sinatra URL Shortner w/Comments

Create a URL shortner. 

There should be an index page that lists all shortened URLs. On this page there should be a 'discuss' link to a discussion page about each URL. On that page you can create comments about the URL. 

You can either have a 'new' page for creating new shortened URLs, or you can do it from the index page with a form. 
Current todos:
get discuss page working
-figure out why a # is generated everytime -a url is put into the database
-create a better short url system
